The FBI conducts checks on prospective firearm buyers prior to their purchase. Information regarding buyers is usually relayed through the seller to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NCIS) staff that performs the background check to confirm whether or not this buyer is eligible. The FBI has provided data on number of requests made to own firearms by month, state and type covering the period from November 1998 â€“ January 2021.
